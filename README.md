# UCanFinish Student Scheduler
## Course Schedule + Planner app for students (for Richard Leinecker's COP4331C class, oriented towards UCF students)

This project was originally a team effort, and I can't take the credit for it without acknowledging my group members. The project is kept in its original state at https://github.com/COP4331C/StudentScheduler, where you can also see who worked on it.

This fork will be my attempt to update certain parts of the project as I try to host it in a more permanent state - the original project had some glaring security issues that need to be fixed before this is possible.

---- (original README follows) ----

Designed using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. Previously hosted on a free AWS instance.

Project is partially complete:
  + Full API functionality
  + Complete front-end/UX design
  - Front-end does not properly communicate with the database to populate student events + tasks
  - (landing2.html provides a more visually functional front-end, landing.html provides a more complex front-end that demonstrates basic communication with the API).
  
## Running this project:
You will need a GNU/Linux machine running the Apache HTTP server and MySQL database server.

API expects a database with the following structure:
